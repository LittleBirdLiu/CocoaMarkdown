=============

 Hello,
 
 This is a quick-and-dirty port of the Perl original to
 2013-era Objective C. There may be mistakes and typosâ€”if
 so, let me know. This is a "literal" translation, in
 that it tries to replicate the original, line-by-line.
 There are some places where a more Objective-C-ish
 construct could be used, but I've tried to keep it
 close as possible to the original. Hopefully that makes
 it easier to track down and debug any discrepancies
 between the output of this version and the original.
 
 On most lines, I kept the original Perl as a comment,
 so you can see exactly where I went wrong if something
 is broken.
 
 Happy Markdowning,
